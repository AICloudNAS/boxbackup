Box Backup, http://www.boxbackup.org/

Copyright (c) 2003-2015, Ben Summers and contributors.
All rights reserved.

The license of the code was changed on 23-Jan-2010 in order to meet the
Fedora Project's definition of Free Software, and therefore allow inclusion
in Fedora, Red Hat Linux and CentOS. This also solves a long-standing
incompatibility with the GNU Readline library that prevented us from
distributing Box Backup binaries compiled against that library. You can
review our discussions of the change in the mailing list archives at:
http://lists.boxbackup.org/pipermail/boxbackup/2010-January/000005.html

Note that this project uses mixed licensing. Different parts of the project
may be used and distributed under different licenses, as described below.
