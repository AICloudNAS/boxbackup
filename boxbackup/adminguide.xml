    <title>Configuration</title>

    <section>
      <title>System configuration</title>

      <section>
        <title>Server</title>

        <para>After you've downloaded and compiled the programs you need to
        install the programs on your server. As root do the following:</para>

        <programlisting>make install-backup-server</programlisting>

        <para>This assumes that you are installing on the same server that you
        compiled the software on. If not, copy the
        boxbackup-x.xx-backup-server-OSNAME.tgz file to the server you want to
        run on, and install there. For example (on Mac OS X):</para>

        <programlisting>tar zxvf boxbackup-0.10-server-darwin8.5.0.tgz
cd boxbackup-0.10-server-darwin8.5.0
./install-backup-server</programlisting>

        <para>Then create the user for the backup daemon on the server:</para>

        <programlisting>useradd _bbstored</programlisting>

        <para>Box Backup has a built-in software RAID facility (redundant
        array of inexpensive disks) for the backup store. This allows you to
        spread the store data over three disks, and recover from the loss of
        any one disk without losing data. However, this is now deprecated, and
        you are recommended to use the software or hardware RAID facilities of
        your operating system instead. Use the following command if you want
        to create a simple server without Box Backup RAID:</para>

        <programlisting>mkdir /tmp/boxbackupRepository                        # Create the directory
chown _bbstored /tmp/boxbackupRepository/             # Change the owner to the new boxbackup daemon user

/usr/local/bin/raidfile-config /etc/box/  1024 /tmp/boxbackupRepository

#substitute 1024 with the desired blocksize
#substitute /tmp/boxbackupRepository with a directory that exists where you want the backup store located
#/usr/local/bin/raidfile-config --help shows you the options</programlisting>

        <para>Then create the configuration file /etc/box/bbstored.conf The
        hostname is tricky as it is used for two things: The name of the
        server in the certificate and the address the server is listening on.
        Since you might be using NAT, might move the server around or the
        domain name might change, choose a name that describes the server.
        When the network address of the server changes, you need to update the
        <literal>ListenAddresses</literal> directive in the
        <filename>/etc/box/bbstored.conf</filename> file.</para>

        <programlisting>/usr/local/bin/bbstored-config /etc/box hostname _bbstored</programlisting>

        <para>This last step outputs 5 instructions that you must execute to
        the letter. A lot of questions are raised on the mailing list because
        these steps have not been followed properly.</para>

        <para>TODO: Expand on this. Explain the 5 steps in detail.</para>

        <para>If you want to run the server as a non-root user, look <link
        linkend="WORoot">here</link>.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Certificate Management</title>

        <para>There are two steps involved to create an account. You need to
        create the account on the server, and sign a certificate to give the
        client permission to connect to the server.</para>

        <para>Running a Certification Authority for TLS (SSL) connections is
        not trivial. However, a script to does most of the work in a way which
        should be good enough for most deployments.</para>

        <important>
          <para>The certificate authority directory is intended to be stored
          on another server. It should not be kept on the backup server, in
          order to limit the impact of a server compromise. The instructions
          and the script assume that it will be kept elsewhere, so will ask
          you to copy files to and from the CA.</para>
        </important>

        <warning>
          <para>SSL certificates contain validity dates, including a "valid
          from" time. If the clock on the machine which signs the certificates
          is not syncronised to the clocks of the machines using these
          certificates, you will probably get strange errors until the start
          time is reached on all machines. If you get strange errors when
          attempting to use new certificates, check the clocks on all machines
          (client, store and CA). You will probably just need to wait a while
          until the certificates become valid, rather than having to
          regenerate them.</para>
        </warning>

        <section>
          <title>Set up a Certificate Authority</title>

          <para>It is recommended that you keep your Certificate Authority on
          a separate machine than either the client or the server, preferably
          without direct network access. The contents of this directory
          control who can access your backup store server.</para>

          <para>To setup the basic key structure, do the following:</para>

          <programlisting>/usr/local/bin/bbstored-certs ca init</programlisting>

          <para>(See <ulink url="instguide.xml">OpenSSL notes</ulink> if you
          get an OpenSSL error)</para>

          <para>This creates the directory called <filename>ca</filename> in
          the current directory, and initialises it with basic keys.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Sign a server certificate</title>

          <para>When you use the <command>bbstored-config</command> script to
          set up a config file for a server, it will generate a certificate
          request (CSR) for you. Transfer it to the machine with your CA, then
          do:</para>

          <programlisting>/usr/local/bin/bbstored-certs ca sign-server hostname-csr.pem</programlisting>

          <para>This signs the certificate for the server. Follow the
          instructions in the output on which files to install on the server.
          The CSR file is now no longer needed. Make sure you run this command
          from the directory above the directory 'ca'.</para>

          <para>TODO: Explain instructions in output.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Set up an account</title>

          <para>Choose an account number for the user. This must be unique on
          the server, and is presented as a 31 bit number in hex greater than
          0, for example, 1 or 75AB23C. Then on the backup store server,
          create the account with:</para>

          <programlisting>/usr/local/bin/bbstoreaccounts create 75AB23C 0 4096M 4505M</programlisting>

          <para>This looks complicated. The numbers are, in order:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>The account number allocated (hex)</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>The RAID disc set (0 if you use raidfile-config and don't
              add a new set)</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Soft limit (size)</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Hard limit (size)</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>

          <para>The sizes are are specified in Mb, Gb, or blocks, depending on
          the suffix. 1M specifies 1 Mb, 1G specifies 1 Gb, and 1B specifies 1
          block, the size of which depends on how you have configured the
          raidfile system with raidfile-config.</para>

          <para>In this example, I have allocated 4Gb (assuming you use 2048
          byte blocks as per my example) as the soft limit, and 4Gb + 10% as
          the hard limit.</para>

          <para>NOTE The sizes specified here are pre-RAID. So if you are
          using userland RAID, you are actually allocating two-thirds of this
          amount. This means that, when you take compression into account,
          that if you allocate 2Gb on the server, it'll probably hold about
          2Gb of backed up files (depending on the compressability of those
          files).</para>

          <para>The backup client will (voluntarily) try not to upload more
          data than is allowed by the soft limit. The store server will refuse
          to accept a file if it would take it over the hard limit, and when
          doing housekeeping for this account, try and delete old versions and
          deleted files to reduce the space taken to below the soft
          limit.</para>

          <para>This command will create some files on disc in the raid file
          directories (if you run as root, the utility will change to the user
          specified in the bbstored.conf file to write them) and update the
          accounts file. A server restart is not required.</para>

          <para>NOTE If you get a message saying 'Exception: RaidFile (2/8)',
          the directories you specified in the raidfile.conf are not writable
          by the _bbstored user -- fix it, and try again.</para>

          <para>Finally, tell the user their account number, and the hostname
          of your server. They will use this to set up the backup client, and
          send you a CSR. This has the account number embedded in it, and you
          should be sure that it has the right account number in it.</para>

          <para>Sign this CSR with this command:</para>

          <programlisting>/usr/local/bin/bbstored-certs ca sign 75AB23C-csr.pem</programlisting>

          <para>Don't forget to check that the embedded account number is
          correct! Then send the two files back to the user, as instructed by
          the script.</para>

          <para>Please read the Troubleshooting page if you have
          problems.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Log Files</title>

        <para>You may wish to see what's going on with the server. Edit
        /etc/syslog.conf, and add:</para>

        <programlisting>local6.info                         /var/log/box
local5.info                         /var/log/raidfile</programlisting>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Note:</emphasis> Separators must be tabs,
        otherwise these entries will be ignored.</para>

        <programlisting>touch /var/log/box
touch /var/log/raidfile</programlisting>

        <para>Set up log rotation for these new log files. For example, if you
        have <filename>/etc/newsyslog.conf</filename>, add the following lines
        to it:</para>

        <programlisting>/var/log/box                644  7    2000 *     Z
/var/log/raidfile           644  7    2000 *     Z</programlisting>

        <para>If you have <filename>/etc/logrotate.d</filename>, create a new
        file in there (for example
        <filename>/etc/logrotate.d/boxbackup</filename>) containing the
        following:</para>

        <programlisting>/var/log/box /var/log/raidfile {
        weekly
        create
        compress
        rotate 52
}</programlisting>

        <para>Then restart syslogd, for example:</para>

        <programlisting>/etc/init.d/syslogd restart</programlisting>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Configuring a client</title>

        <para>Before you can do any configuration, you need to know the
        hostname of the server you will be using, and your account number on
        that server.</para>

        <para>Later in the process, you will need to send a certificate
        request to the administrator of that server for it to be
        signed.</para>

        <para>Installation is covered in the compiling and installing section.
        You only need the backup-client parcel.</para>

        <para>It is important that you read all the output of the config
        scripts. See the end of this page for an example.</para>

        <para>The backup client has to be run as root, because it needs to
        read all your files to back them up, although it is possible to back
        up a single user's files by running it as that user. (Tip: specify a
        directory other than <filename>/etc/box</filename>, and then give the
        alternate config file as the first argument to
        <command>bbackupd</command>). However, it will fall over if you don't
        give yourself read access to one of your files.</para>

        <section>
          <title id="BasicConfig">Basic configuration</title>

          <para>Run the <command>bbackupd-config</command> script to generate
          the configuration files and generate a private key and certificate
          request.</para>

          <programlisting>/usr/local/bin/bbackupd-config /etc/box lazy <emphasis
              role="bold">999 hostname</emphasis> /var/bbackupd <emphasis
              role="bold">/home</emphasis></programlisting>

          <para>(See <ulink url="instguide.xml">OpenSSL notes</ulink> if you
          get an OpenSSL error)</para>

          <para>The items in bold need to be changed. In order, they are the
          account number, the hostname of the server you're using, and
          finally, the directories you want backed up. You can include as many
          you want here.</para>

          <para>However, the directories you specify must not contain other
          mounted file systems within them at any depth. Specify them
          separately, one per mount point. No checks are currently made to
          catch bad configuration of this nature!</para>

          <para>You may also want to consider changing the mode from lazy to
          snapshot, depending on what your system is used for:</para>

          <glosslist>
            <glossentry>
              <glossterm>Lazy Mode</glossterm>

              <glossdef>
                <para>This mode regularly scans the files, with only a rough
                schedule. It uploads files as and when they are changed, if
                the latest version is more than a set age. This is good for
                backing up user's documents stored on a server, and spreads
                the load out over the day.</para>
              </glossdef>
            </glossentry>

            <glossentry>
              <glossterm>Snapshot Mode</glossterm>

              <glossdef>
                <para>This mode emulates the traditional backup behaviour of
                taking a snapshot of the filesystem. The backup daemon does
                absolutely nothing until it is instructed to make a backup
                using the bbackupctl utility (probably as a cron job), at
                which point it uploads all files which have been changed since
                the last time it uploaded.</para>
              </glossdef>
            </glossentry>
          </glosslist>

          <para>When you run the config script, it will tell you what you need
          to do next. Don't forget to read all the output. An example is shown
          at the end of this page, but the instructions for your installation
          may be different.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Certificates</title>

          <para>After you have sent your certificate request off to the server
          administrator and received your certificate and CA root back,
          install them where instructed by the bbackupd-config script during
          basic bbackupd configuration.</para>

          <para>You can then run the daemon (as root) by running
          <command>/usr/local/bin/bbackupd</command>, and of course, adding it
          to your system's startup scripts. The first time it's run it will
          upload everything. Interrupting it and restarting it will only
          upload files which were not uploaded before - it's very
          tolerant.</para>

          <para>If you run in snapshot mode, you will need to add a cron job
          to schedule backups. The config script will tell you the exact
          command to use for your system.</para>

          <para>Please read the Troubleshooting page if you have
          problems.</para>

          <para>Remember to make a traditional backup of the keys file, as
          instructed. You cannot restore files without it.</para>

          <para>It is recommended that you backup up all of /etc/box as it
          will make things easier if you need to restore files. But only the
          keys are absolutely essential.</para>

          <para>If you want to see what it's doing in more detail (probably a
          good idea), follow the instructions in the server setup to create
          new log files with syslog. </para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Adding and removing backed up locations</title>

          <para>By editing the /etc/box/bbackupd.conf file, you can add and
          remove directories to back up - see comments in this file for help.
          Send bbackupd a HUP signal after you modify it.</para>

          <para>When you remove a location, it will not be marked as deleted
          immediately. Instead, bbackupd waits about two days before doing so,
          just in case you change your mind. After this, it will be eventually
          removed from the store by the housekeeping process. Run as
          root.</para>

          <para>The backup client is designed to be run as root. It is
          possible to run without root, but this is not recommended. Clock
          synchronisation for file servers.</para>

          <para>If you are using the backup client to backup a filesystem
          served from a fileserver, you should ideally ensure that the
          fileserver clocks are synchronised with the fileserver.</para>

          <para>bbackupd will cope perfectly well if the clocks are not
          synchronised. Errors up to about half an hour cause no problems.
          Larger discrepancies cause a loss of efficiency and the potential to
          back up a file during a write process.</para>

          <para>There is a configuration parameter MaxFileTimeInFuture, which
          specifies how far in the future a file must be for it to be uploaded
          as soon as it is seen. You should not need to adjust this (default
          is 2 days). Instead, get those clocks synchronised. Excluding files
          and directories from the backup.</para>

          <para>Within the bbackupd.conf file, there is a section named
          BackupLocations which specifies which locations on disc should be
          backed up. It has subsections, each of which is in the
          format:</para>

          <programlisting> name
 {
    Path = /path/of/directory
    (optional exclude directives)
 }</programlisting>

          <para><emphasis role="bold">name</emphasis> is derived from the Path
          by the config script, but should merely be unique.</para>

          <para>The exclude directives are of the form:</para>

          <programlisting>[Exclude|AlwaysInclude][File|Dir][|sRegex] = regex or full pathname</programlisting>

          <para>(The regex suffix is shown as 'sRegex' to make File or Dir

Setup bbackupd config utility.

Configuration:
   Writing configuration file: /etc/box/bbackupd.conf
   Account: 51
   Server hostname: server.example.com
   Directories to back up:
      /home
      /etc/samba

Note: If other file systems are mounted inside these directories, then problems may occur
with files on the store server being renamed incorrectly. This will cause efficiency
problems, but not affect the integrity of the backups.

WARNING: Directories not checked against mountpoints. Check mounted filesystems manually.

Writing configuration file /etc/box/bbackupd.conf

===================================================================

bbackupd basic configuration complete.

What you need to do now...

1) Make a backup of /etc/box/bbackupd/51-FileEncKeys.raw
   This should be a secure offsite backup.
   Without it, you cannot restore backups. Everything else can
   be replaced. But this cannot.
   KEEP IT IN A SAFE PLACE, OTHERWISE YOUR BACKUPS ARE USELESS.

2) Send /etc/box/bbackupd/51-csr.pem
   to the administrator of the backup server, and ask for it to
   be signed.

3) The administrator will send you two files. Install them as
      /etc/box/bbackupd/51-cert.pem
      /etc/box/bbackupd/serverCA.pem
   after checking their authenticity.

4) You may wish to read the configuration file
      /etc/box/bbackupd.conf
   and adjust as appropraite.
   
   There are some notes in it on excluding files you do not
   wish to be backed up.

5) Review the script
      /etc/box/bbackupd/NotifyStoreFull.sh
   and check that it will email the right person when the store
   becomes full. This is important -- when the store is full, no
   more files will be backed up. You want to know about this.

6) Start the backup daemon with the command
      /usr/local/bin/bbackupd
   in /etc/rc.local, or your local equivalent.
   Note that bbackupd must run as root.

}</programlisting>
        </example>

        <para>As you can see from the example above, the configuration file
        has a number of subsections, enclosed in curly braces {}. Some options
        appear outside of any subsection, and we will refer to these as <link
        linkend="RootOptions">root options</link>. The available options in
        each section are described below.</para>

        <para>Every option has the form <quote>name = value</quote>. Names are
        not case-sensitive, but values are. Depending on the option, the value
        may be:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>a path (to a file or directory);</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>a number (usually in seconds or bytes);</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>a boolean (the word Yes or No);</para>
          </listitem>

            <para>a hostname (or IP address).</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>Paths are specified in native format, i.e. a full Windows path
        with drive letter on Windows clients, or a full Unix path on Unix
        clients.</para>

        <para><example>
            <title>Example:</title>

            <para>StoreObjectInfoFile =

            <para>StoreObjectInfoFile = C:\Program Files\Box
            Backup\data\bbackupd.dat</para>
          </example>The use of relative paths (which do not start with a
        forward slash on Unix, or a drive specification on Windows) is
        possible but not recommended, since they are interpreted relative to
        the current working directory when bbackupd was started, which is
        liable to change unexpectedly over time.</para>

        <para>Numbers which start with "0x" are interpreted as hexadecimal.
        Numbers which do not start with "0x" are interpreted as
        decimal.</para>

          <title id="RootOptions">Root Options</title>

          <para>These options appear outside of any subsection. By convention
          they are at the beginning of the configuration file.</para>

          <para>Some options are required, and some are optional.</para>

              <glossdef>
                <para>The number of the client's account on the server. This
                must be provided by the server operator, and must match the
                account number in the client's certificate, otherwise the
                client will not be able to log into the server.</para>

                <para>The account number may be specified in hexadecimal
                (starting with 0x, as in the example above) or in decimal, but
                since the server operator works in hexadecimal, that format is

                <para>The path to the file containing the encryption key used
                for data encryption of client file data and filenames. This is
                the most important file to keep safe, since without it your
                backups cannot be decrypted and are useless. Likewise, if an

                change it back, none of the files uploaded with the new key

                <para>The path to the OpenSSL client certificate in PEM
                format. This is supplied by the server operator in response to
                the certificate request which you send to them. Together with
                the PrivateKeyFile, this provides access to the store server
                and the encrypted data stored there.</para>

                <para>It is not critical to protect this file or to back it up
                safely, since it can be regenerated by creating a new
                certificate request, and asking the server operator to sign
                it. You may wish to back it up, together with the
                PrivateKeyFile, to avoid this inconvenience if you lose all
                your data and need quick access to your backups.</para>

                <para>If you do back them up, you should keep them in a
                separate location to the KeysFile, since any person holding
                the KeysFile and the PrivateKeyFile can gain access to your
                encrypted data and decrypt it.</para>

                <para>The path to the OpenSSL private key in PEM format. This
                is generated at the same time as the certificate request, but
                there is no need to send it to the server operator, and you
                should not do so, in case the communication is intercepted by
                an attacker. Together with the CertificateFile, this provides
                access to the store server and the encrypted data stored
                there.</para>

                along with your signed client certificate. This is used to
                verify that the server which you are connecting to is
                authorised by the person who signed your certificate. It

                synchronisation problems, it is inevitable that you will
                occasionally see files timestamped in the future. Normally,
                for files which are dated only slightly in the future, you
                will want to wait until after the file's date before backing

                are quick to upload again in full, and sending the entire file
                reduces the risk of data loss if the store is accidentally

          client attempts to back up. Once the file has been closed, it will
          be backed up normally. System files will always be open, and should

          <title>Using bbackupquery</title>

          <para>bbackupquery is the tool you use to verify, restore and
          investigate your backup files with. When invoked, it simply logs
          into the server using the certificates you have listed in
          bbackupd.conf.</para>

          <para>After you run bbackupquery, you will see a prompt, allowing
          you to execute commands. The list (or ls) command lets you view
          files in the store. It works much like unix ls, but with different
          options. An example:</para>

          <title>Verify backups</title>

          <para>As with any backup system, you should frequently check that
          your backups are working properly by comparing them. Box Backup
          makes this very easy and completely automatic. All you have to do is
          schedule the <command>bbackupquery compare</command> command to run
          regularly, and check its output. You can run the command manually as
          follows:</para>

          <programlisting>/usr/local/bin/bbackupquery "compare -a" quit</programlisting>

          <para>This command will report all the differences found between the
          store and the files on disc. It will download everything, so may
          take a while. You should expect to see some differences on a typical
          compare, because files which have recently changed are unlikely to
          have been uploaded yet. It will also tell you how many files have
          been modified since the last backup run, since these will normally
          have changed, and such failures are expected.</para>

          <para>You are strongly recommended to add this command as a
          <command>cron</command> job, at least once a month, and to check the
          output for anything suspicious, particularly a large number of
          compare failures, failures on files that have not been modified, or
          any error (anything except a compare mismatch) that occurs during
          the compare operation.</para>

          <para>Consider keeping a record of these messages and comparing them
          with a future verification.</para>

          <para>If you would like to do a "quick" check which just downloads
          file checksums and compares against that, then run:</para>

          <programlisting>/usr/local/bin/bbackupquery "compare -aq" quit</programlisting>

          <para>However, this does not check that the file attributes are
          correct, and since the checksums are generated on the client they
          may not reflect the data on the server if there is a problem -- the
          server cannot check the encrypted contents. View this as a quick
          indication, rather than a definite check that your backup verifies
          correctly.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Restore backups</title>

          <para>You will need the keys file created when you configured the
          server. Without it, you cannot restore the files; this is the
          downside of encrypted backups. However, by keeping the small keys
          file safe, you indirectly keep your entire backup safe.</para>

          <para>The first step is to recreate the configuration of the backup
          client. It's probably best to have stored the /etc/box directory
          with your keys. But if you're recreating it, all you really need is
          to have got the login infomation correct (ie the certs and
          keys).</para>

          <para>Don't run bbackupd yet! It will mark all your files as deleted
          if you do, which is not hugely bad in terms of losing data, just a
          major inconvenience. (This assumes that you are working from a blank
          slate. If you want to restore some files to a different location,
          it's fine to restore while bbackupd is running, just do it outside a
          backed up directory to make sure it doesn't start uploading the
          restored files.)</para>

          <para>Type:</para>

          <programlisting>/usr/local/bin/bbackupquery</programlisting>

          <para>to run it in interactive mode.</para>

          <para>Type:</para>

          <programlisting>list</programlisting>

          <para>to see a list of the locations stored on the server.</para>

          <para>For each location you want to restore, type:</para>

          <programlisting>restore name-on-server local-dir-name</programlisting>

          <para>The directory specified by local-dir-name must not exist yet.
          If the restore is interrupted for any reason, repeat the above
          steps, but add the <emphasis role="bold">-r</emphasis> flag to the
          restore command to tell it to resume.</para>

          <title>Retrieving deleted and old files</title>

          <para>Box Backup makes old versions of files and files you have
          deleted available, subject to there being enough disc space on the
          server to hold them.</para>

          <para>This is how to retrieve them using bbackupquery. Future
          versions will make this far more user-friendly.</para>

          <para>Firstly, run bbackupquery in interactive mode. It behaves in a
          similar manner to a command line sftp client.</para>

          <programlisting>/usr/local/bin/bbackupquery</programlisting>

          <para>Then navigate to the directory containing the file you want,
          using list, cd and pwd.</para>

          <programlisting>query &gt; cd home/profiles/USERNAME</programlisting>

          <para>List the directory, using the "o" option to list the files
          available without filtering out everything apart from the current

      <title id="FixCorruptions">Fixing corruptions of store data</title>

      <para>This section gives help on what to do if your server has suffered
      corruption, for example, after an unclean shutdown or other operating
      system or hardware problem.</para>

      <para>In general, as updates to the store are made in an atomic manner,
      the most likely result is wasted disc space. However, if really bad
      things happen, or you believe that there is a lot of wasted space, then
      these instructions will help to restore your data.</para>

      <para>You know you will need to do something if you get strange errors,
      and bbackupd attempts to contact the server every 100 seconds or so. Or
      if one of the discs in your RAID disc set has failed.</para>

      <para>After following these instructions, the end result will be that
      bbackupquery will be able to see all the files which were stored on your
      server, and retrieve them. Some of them may be in lost+found directories
      in the root of the store (or in their original position if they have
      been moved) but they will all be able to be retrieved.</para>

      <para>After you have retrieved the files you want, bbackupd will upload
      new versions where necessary, and after about two days, mark any
      lost+found directories as deleted. Finally, those directories will be
      removed by the housekeeping process on the server.</para>

      <para>These instructions assume you're working on account 1234. Replace
      this with the account number that you actually want to check (the one
      that is experiencing errors). These steps will need to be repeated for
      all affected accounts.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Stop bbackupd</title>

        <para>First, make sure that bbackupd is not running on the client
        machine for the account you are going to recover. Use
        <command>bbackupctl terminate</command> to stop it. This step is not
        strictly necessary, but is recommended. During any checks on the
        account, bbackupd will be unable to log in, and after they are
        complete, the account is marked as changed on the server so bbackupd
        will perform a complete scan.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Are you using RAID on the server?</title>

        <para>The raidfile recovery tools have not been written, and probably
        will not be, since Box Backup RAID is deprecated. However, when two
        out of three files are available, the server will successfully allow
        access to your data, even if it complains a lot in the logs. The best
        thing to do is to fix the accounts, if necessary, and retrieve any
        files you need. Then move the old store directories aside (in case you
        need them) and start afresh with new accounts, and let the clients
        upload all their data again.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Check and fix the account</title>

        <para>First, run the check utility, and see what errors it
        reports.</para>

        <programlisting>/usr/local/bin/bbstoreaccounts check 1234</programlisting>

        <para>This will take some time, and use a fair bit of memory (about 16
        bytes per file and directory). If the output looks plausible and
        reports errors which need fixing, run it again but with the fix
        flag:</para>

        <programlisting>/usr/local/bin/bbstoreaccounts check 1234 fix</programlisting>

        <para>This will fix any errors, and remove unrecoverable files.
        Directories will be recreated if necessary.</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">NOTE</emphasis>: The utility may adjust
        the soft and hard limits on the account to make sure that housekeeping
        will not remove anything -- check these afterwards.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Grab any files you need with bbackupquery</title>

        <para>At this point, you will have a working store. Every file which
        was on the server, and wasn't corrupt, will be available.</para>

        <para>On the client, use bbackupquery to log in and examine the store.
        (type help at the prompt for instructions). Retrieve any files you
        need, paying attention to any lost+found directories in the root
        directory of the store.</para>

        <para>You can skip this step if you are sure that the client machine
        is fine -- in this case, bbackupd will bring the store up to
        date.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Restart bbackupd</title>

        <para>Restart bbackupd on the client machine. The store account will
        be brought up to date, and files in the wrong place will be marked for
        eventual deletion.</para>

      <para>Unfortunately, the error messages are not particularly helpful at
      the moment. This page lists some of the common errors, and the most
      likely causes of them.</para>

      <para>When an error occurs, you will see a message like 'Exception:

      (it is recommended you set up another log file as recommended in the
      server setup instructions.)</para>

      <para>This error may not be particularly helpful, although some do have
      extra information about probable causes. To get further information,
      check the ExceptionCodes.txt file in the root of the distribution. This

        <para>The server can't listen for connections on the IP address
        specified when you configured it.</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Problem</emphasis>: This probably means

        <title>Connection (7/x)</title>

        <para>These errors all relate to connections failing -- you may see
        them during operation if there are network failures or other problems
        between the client and server. The backup system will recover from
        them automatically.</para>

          <title>Connection (7/30) - SSL problems</title>

          <para>Log snippet from client side:</para>

        <title>Advanced troubleshooting</title>

        <para>If this really doesn't help, then using the DEBUG builds of the
        system will give you much more information -- a more descriptive
        exception message and the file and line number where the error
        occurred.</para>

        <para>For example, if you are having problems with bbstoreaccounts,
        build the debug version with:</para>

        <programlisting>cd boxbackup-0.0
cd bin/bbstoreaccounts
make</programlisting>

        <para>Within the module directories, make defaults to building the
        debug version. At the top level, it defaults to release.</para>

        <para>This will build an executable in debug/bin/bbstoreaccounts which
        you can then use instead of the release version. It will give far more
        useful error messages.</para>

        <para>When you get an error message, use the file and line number to
        locate where the error occurs in the code. There will be comments
        around that line to explain why the exception happened.</para>

        <para>If you are using a debug version of a daemon, these extended
        messages are found in the log files.</para>

    <title id="WORoot">Running without root</title>

    <para>It is possible to run both the server and client without root
    privileges.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Server</title>

      <para>The server, by default, runs as a non-root user. However, it
      expects to be run as root and changes user to a specified user as soon
      as it can, simply for administrative convenience. The server uses a port
      greater than 1024, so it doesn't need root to start.</para>

      <para>To run it entirely as a non-root user, edit the bbstored.conf
      file, and remove the User directive from the Server section. Then simply
      run the server as your desired user.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Client</title>

      <para>The client requires root for normal operation, since it must be
      able to access all files to back them up. However, it is possible to run
      the client as a non-root user, with certain limitations.</para>

      <para>Follow the installation instructions, but install the executable
      files manually to somewhere in your home directory. Then use
      bbackupd-config to configure the daemon, but use a directory other than
      /etc/box, probably somewhere in your home directory.</para>

      <para>All directories you specify to be backed up must be readable, and
      all files must be owned by the user and readable to that user.</para>

      <para>Important: If any file or directory is not readable by this user,
      the backup process will skip that file or directory. Keep an eye on the
      logs for reports of this failure.</para>

      <para>Non-root operation of the backup client is recommended only for
      testing, and should not be relied on in a production environment.</para>
