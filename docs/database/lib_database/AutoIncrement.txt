TITLE Auto-incrementing columns

All database servers have a way of generating unique IDs for inserted rows by defining a column to have a special type. If a value for this column is not specified in the SQL INSERT statement, then the database server sets the value itself. This value is usually one more than the last value automatically inserted, although it may be MAX(colname)+1. The value can then be retrieved by another SQL statement or an API call -- effectively an atomic operation so multiple processes can use this at once.

The drivers abstract this behaviour out, and the autogenerated query objects make the retrieval of this value cleaner.

Each server has it's own way of specifying these columns, so the column type is abstracted by using the `AUTO_INCREMENT_INT column type. The column type will be

* Indexed
* Marked as the PRIMARY KEY
* Must be UNIQUE
* Only used once in a table

Because most servers only allow the retrieval of the last inserted value in the session, this is necessarily an operation on the DatabaseConnection object, with the GetLastAutoIncrementValue() method returning the integer. Since some servers require the table and column name, this must be passed in.

Autogenerated query objects which use the AutoIncrementValue attribute have a InsertedValue() function which takes no arguments, and can be used at any time after the query has been executed, even if another one is executed in the meantime. (This works by simply calling GetLastAutoIncrementValue() after the query has executed, and recording the value.)

See test/database for examples.
