Notes for Translators
=====================

IMPORTANT NOTE.

Read all this file before commencing work.

You must work on all files with a text editor which supports editing files in the UTF-8 character set. If you are not sure whether your software is suitable, please check before commencing work. Translations performed in other character sets are often useless.

Make sure your software is actually a text editor. Software like Microsoft Word is not a text editor. Text editors do not offer the ability to style text (for example, making text bold).

It cannot be stressed enough that you must edit the files in a suitable text editor!

Because your translations are processed by a computer program, there are rigid rules on what you can and cannot do. Please follow them exactly to avoid wasting work.

If you are not sure about something, ask.

Please translate a few items, and send them back for checking before doing all the work, just in case!


HTML FILES

Some of the text you are asked to translate will be in the form of HTML files. Please edit the files in the UTF-8 charset, and maintain the formatting whereever possible.


LANGUAGE FILES

Most of the text is in a text file, formatted to make it easy to translate. An example entry looks like this

========
# 15505f2831f5703de81dcb263d1d7b23-h
@ Main RequestInfo AnotherPage
> The rain in Spain falls
> mainly on the plain.

The rain in Spain falls
mainly on the plain.

========

In order, the lines are

Text identifier (line begins #)
Pages on which the text appears (line begins @)
Original text (lines beginning >)

The rest of the text is original text repeated. This is the text you need to edit.

Do not change any lines beginning with #, @ or > . If you change these lines, your language file will not work.

The original text is provided to help you. Do not change it!

The list of pages the text appears on is provided to help you see the text in context, if needed. Do not change the list.

Leave a blank line above and below your translated text. It doesn't matter how many lines your translation takes up.


As an example of what is required, the above entry might be translated as

========
# 15505f2831f5703de81dcb263d1d7b23-h
@ Main RequestInfo AnotherPage
> The rain in Spain falls
> mainly on the plain.

La lluvia en
Espana cae principalmente
en el llano.

COMPUTER READABLE MARKERS

Within some of the strings, you may find computer readable markers and HTML markup. You MUST NOT translate these markers.

HTML is entities within angle brackets, for example, <b>.

The markers are entities within curly brackets, for example, {name.Other}.

HTML and the markers should be left untranslated, and with their brackets intact.

For example, consider this

========
# with_markup-h
@ RequestInfo
> This is a sentence with some <b>HTML markup.</b>
> This is a link {['Name', 'Param' => 'Value']}. This is a marker to
> show where to insert from data from the system: {widgets.Item},
> and this is another: {=std::string userID}.

This is a sentence with some <b>HTML markup.</b>
This is a link {['Name', 'Param' => 'Value']}. This is a marker to
show where to insert from data from the system: {widgets.Item},
and this is another: {=std::string userID}.

========

Within this example, the following strings must not be translated:

  <b>
  </b>
  {['Name', 'Param' => 'Value']}
  {widgets.Item}
  {=std::string userID}




Thank you for your tolerance!
