TITLE Getting started

There's a bit of boilerplate code which needs to be written to start an application. This needs to be customised slightly to the names of the web application. A script is provided to do the hard work.

Extract the archive to get a directory like 'boxwaf-0.00'. Then

cd boxwaf-0.00
lib/webappframework/genstarterapp.pl

and answer the questions. Then follow the instructions for building and running the application which the script will emit.


SUBTITLE Example

The web application in test/webappframework illustrates the use of all the Units documented. To build and try this, do

cd test/webappframework
make
cd ../../debug/test/webappframework
./t

and then follow the instructions for running the test application. This has two "languages", one which is normal english, and the other where everything is in captial letters.
