TITLE Form Containers

Form Containers are simply Units which contain other objects, and are using with Forms. They implement a few extra methods to support Form functions. None is strictly necessary -- the Form object will provide sensible defaults.


SUBTITLE get_form_template_fragment(fragment_name)

Returns a text fragment for use in templating (not subject to translation), or undef if the default should be used. The null string may have special meaning.

See Forms.txt, Form Unit subsection, for a list of markers which could be supported.
