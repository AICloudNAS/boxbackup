# This script is run whenever bbackupd changes state or encounters a
# problem which requires the system administrator to assist:
#
# 1) The store is full, and no more data can be uploaded.
# 2) Some files or directories were not readable.
# 3) A backup run starts or finishes.
#
# The default script emails the system administrator, except for backups
# starting and stopping, where it does nothing.
#
# NOTE: You need to edit the following variables in the script before
# enabling it:
#
# account = "accountnumber"
# sendto = "your@email.address"
# smtpserver = "your.smtp.server"
#
# You do not need to set smtpserver if the client has the SMTP Service
# installed, the script will connect directly to the SMTP service.

MinimumFileAge = 21600


# If a file is modified repeated, it won't be uploaded immediately in case 
# it's modified again, due to the MinimumFileAge specified above. However, it 
# should be uploaded eventually even if it is being modified repeatedly. This 
# is how long we should wait, in seconds, after first noticing a change. 
# (86400 seconds = 1 day)

MaxUploadWait = 86400

# If the connection is idle for some time (e.g. over 10 minutes or 600
# seconds, not sure exactly how long) then the server will give up and
# disconnect the client, resulting in Connection Protocol_Timeout errors
# on the server and TLSReadFailed or TLSWriteFailed errors on the client.
# Also, some firewalls and NAT gateways will kill idle connections after
# similar lengths of time. 
#
# This can happen for example when most files are backed up already and
# don't need to be sent to the store again, while scanning a large
# directory, or while calculating diffs of a large file. To avoid this,
# KeepAliveTime specifies that special keep-alive messages should be sent
# when the connection is otherwise idle for a certain length of time,
# specified here in seconds.
#
# The default is that these messages are never sent, equivalent to setting
# this option to zero, but we recommend that all users enable this.

# The limit on how much time is spent diffing files, in seconds. Most files 
# shouldn't take very long, but if you have really big files you can use this 
# to limit the time spent diffing them.
#
# * Reduce if you are having problems with processor usage.
#
# * Increase if you have large files, and think the upload of changes is too 
#   large and you want bbackupd to spend more time searching for unchanged
#   blocks.

# This specifies a program or script script which is run just before each 
# sync, and ideally the full path to the interpreter. It will be run as the 
# same user bbackupd is running as, usually root.
#
# The script must output (print) either "now" or a number to STDOUT (and a 
# terminating newline, no quotes).
#
# If the result was "now", then the sync will happen. If it's a number, then 
# no backup will happen for that number of seconds (bbackupd will pause) and 
# then the script will be run again.
#
# Use this to temporarily stop bbackupd from syncronising or connecting to the 
# store. For example, you could use this on a laptop to only backup when on a 
# specific network, or when it has a working Internet connection.

# Uncomment the StoreObjectInfoFile to enable the experimental archiving

# between backup runs. This saves time and increases efficiency when

# to rescan all directories on the remote server. However, it is new and
# not yet heavily tested, so use with caution.

# BackupLocations specifies which locations on disc should be backed up. Each
# directory is in the format
# 
# 	name
# 	{
# 		Path = /path/of/directory
# 		(optional exclude directives)
# 	}
# 
# 'name' is derived from the Path by the config script, but should merely be
# unique.
# 
# The exclude directives are of the form
# 
# 	[Exclude|AlwaysInclude][File|Dir][|sRegex] = regex or full pathname
# 
# (The regex suffix is shown as 'sRegex' to make File or Dir plural)
#
# For example:
# 
# 	ExcludeDir = /home/guest-user
# 	ExcludeFilesRegex = \.(mp3|MP3)$
# 	AlwaysIncludeFile = /home/username/veryimportant.mp3
# 
# This excludes the directory /home/guest-user from the backup along with all mp3
# files, except one MP3 file in particular.
#
# If a directive ends in Regex, then it is a regular expression rather than a
# explicit full pathname. See:
#
#       http://www.boxbackup.org/trac/wiki/Win32Regex
#
# for more information about regular expressions on Windows.
#
# In general, Exclude excludes a file or directory, unless the directory is
# explicitly mentioned in a AlwaysInclude directive. However, Box Backup
# does NOT scan inside excluded directories and will never back up an
# AlwaysIncluded file or directory inside an excluded directory or any
# subdirectory thereof.
#
# To back up a directory inside an excluded directory, use a configuration
# like this, to ensure that each directory in the path to the important
# files is included, but none of their contents will be backed up except
# the directories further down that path to the important one.
#
# ExcludeDirsRegex = ^/home/user/bigfiles/
# ExcludeFilesRegex = ^/home/user/bigfiles/
# AlwaysIncludeDir = /home/user/bigfiles/path
# AlwaysIncludeDir = /home/user/bigfiles/path/to
# AlwaysIncludeDir = /home/user/bigfiles/path/important
# AlwaysIncludeDir = /home/user/bigfiles/path/important/files
# AlwaysIncludeDirsRegex = ^/home/user/bigfiles/path/important/files/
# AlwaysIncludeFilesRegex = ^/home/user/bigfiles/path/important/files/
#
# Here are some more examples of possible regular expressions for Windows:
#
#       ExcludeDir = C:\Documents and Settings\Owner
#       ExcludeFilesRegex = \.(mp3|MP3)$
#       AlwaysIncludeFile = C:\Documents and Settings\Owner\My Documents\My Music\veryimportant.mp3
#       ExcludeFilesRegex = \.pst$
#       AlwaysIncludeFilesRegex = \.*backup.*\.pst$
