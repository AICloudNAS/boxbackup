# first entry is module name, next entries are dependencies or -l<libname> library includes

# put !<platform-name>,<platform-name> after a module / library to exclude it from a particular platform
# put !+<platform-name>,... to include it only on those platforms

# -l libaries must be in the order they should appear on the command line.
# Note that order is important on platforms which do not have shared libraries.
